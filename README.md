This is a program in Java, using JavaFx as the UI language and can connect to an SQL database.

It has a simple and minimal UI that features 4 main section: Add Employee, Search Employee, Update Salary and Generate Report.
The UI works as intended
It need to connect to a db to actually work, but it has all the connect to work with a db, just need to connect a db to it.

I don't have any idea to improve on this code. So no TODO list.
